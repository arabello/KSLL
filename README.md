# Kotlin Safety Library Loader

Dynamically download libraries in Kotlin/Android with digital signature checking at runtime.

## Why ? 

This is a thesis project at University of Bologna, Italy. 
The idea behind is to prevent personal user data spreading to third-party cloud systems, 
maintaining the feature to provide multiple server-side implementation of a service.
With this Android library you can download at runtime specific `dex` libraries and
retrieve its functionality.

## Usage

The functionality depends on metadata exposed by a server.
A built-in JSON RESTful server support is ready to use.
You can provide a different implementation. See [ServerManager](https://github.com/arabello/KSLL/blob/master/ksll/src/main/java/it/matteopellegrino/ksll/servermanager/ServerManager.kt) for details.
 
The server endpoint, for example `http://example.org:8080`, must returns specific metadata, such as

```
{
    "url": "http://example.org:8080/path/to/binary",
    "sapclassName": "your.sap.class.Name",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "extension": "dex",
    "signature": "DdglDaYEz1ApDmO...df/ydQ1SM=",
    "publicKey":"MIGfMA0GCSq...2+AgtGQIDAQAB"
}
```

To download and use the library exposed by the server

```
val ksll = Ksll(baseContext, RESTManager())

ksll.load("http://example.org:8080", { remoteLib ->
	remoteLib.require{ obj, methods ->
		methods.forEach{ println(it) }
	}
}, { error ->
	println("Error: $error")	
})

```

Also using extension function

```
val ksll = Ksll(baseContext, RESTManager())

"http://example.org:8080".load(ksll, { remoteLib ->
	remoteLib.require{ obj, methods ->
		methods.forEach{ println(it) }
	}
}, { error ->
	println("Error: $error")	
})

```

Callbacks

```
success: (lib: Lib) -> Unit
failure: (cause: Failure) -> Unit
```

Handle different types of error

```
ï»¿ksll.load("http://192.168.1.150:8080", ... , { error ->
        val msg = when(error){
            Failure.NotTrustedData -> "Signature verification failed. Library not trusted."
            Failure.HTTPRequestError -> "Connection problem. Cannot retrieve library."
            else -> {
                "Unexpected error. Cannot load library."
            }
        }

        Toast.makeText(this, msg, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
    }
})
```

Once a library `RemoteLib`/`Lib` is retrieved, to load the invokable methods

```
remoteLib.require(ksll){obj, methods ->

}

lib.require(ksll){obj, methods ->

}
```
